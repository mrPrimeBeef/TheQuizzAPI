## About
TheQuizz API is a knowledge quiz focusing on computer science as a proof of concept. In the future, the quiz can be expanded to cover other scientific topics, and possibly include riddles that can be solved individually. The goal is to create a fun and engaging quiz format that can be used in social settings, such as an activity for a cozy evening.

It is designed to be played using a single device (mobile/computer) for the quiz, not multiple.

Once the proof of concept is completed, more categories will be added.
